## duration in seconds, should be compatiable with fmin
duration=3e6
## segment length for fft in seconds, should be compatiable with fmin
## Note by SB: Looks like this needs to be atleast a factor of 10 larger than 1/fmin
## to give consistant recoveries.
seglen=5e4
## sample rate in Hz, should be compatible with fmax
## Note by SB: Looks like this needs to be atleast a factor of 4
## higher than fmax (as opposed to the usual factor of 2) to give
## consistent recoveries.

## LISA configuration. Can be stationary or orbiting

## Level of the tdi. Can be michelson, xyz or aet

# Doppler or strain data. MLDC data is doppler, owndata is strain. Can be doppler or strain

## If loadResponse is true, then a previously generated set of detector responses is read in from a file. Only use when running repeated analyses on the same data set. Only used for orbiting LISA configuration due to the increased computation time of that case.
## File loaded depends on tdi_lev.
loadResponse=0

## If loadCustom is also true, the detector response arrays will be loaded from files specified by the user (responsefile1,2,3). Specified detector responses should be compatible with tdi_lev.
## IMPORTANT - only load responses when analyzing the dataset originally used to generate them. The code will throw an error if the duration/segment length (dur/seglen) don't match. However, mismatched combinations of data and responses can still function in some cases and will produce erroneous results.

## If FixSeed is true, the sampler will use random states generated by the seed given in the 'seed' parameter below. This allows for reproduction of sampling results; for a given seed value, repeated analyses of the same dataset will produce precisely identical results. The seed can be any unsigned 32-bit integer.
