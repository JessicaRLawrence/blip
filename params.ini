## Note by SB: Looks like this needs to be atleast a factor of 10 larger than 1/fmin
## to give consistant recoveries.

## sample rate in Hz, should be compatible with fmax
## Note by SB: Looks like this needs to be atleast a factor of 4
## higher than fmax (as opposed to the usual factor of 2) to give
